This project is a build chain for DocBook documents, which should be used
for TYPO3. The whole system is using Phing.

Current Status
==============
* Downloads build dependencies (like FOP, XSL Stylesheets)
* Can build rudimentary HTML and PDF versions of documentation

TODO
====

* Decide on output structure
** Multiple versions // Translations
** Idea (as taken from Francois' structure:)
	/TYPO3v4/CoreManuals/doc_core_api/en/current/index.html
	/TYPO3v4/CoreManuals/doc_core_api/en/4.4/index.html
	/TYPO3v4/CoreManuals/doc_core_api/de/4.4/index.html
	/TYPO3v4/CoreManuals/doc_core_api/de/current.pdf
	/TYPO3v4/CoreManuals/doc_core_api/de/4.4.pdf

* Make it possible to render multiple documents at once
** Current idea: Have a "build.properties" file (or something like that) at the top level of each book, and by that we can identify that we are at the top level directory of a book.
** we need a way to define some metadata anyways, for the build process... Like the languages used in the book, or the tags which should be rendered.

* Create convenience tools
** SXW -> DocBook conversion (Fabien)
** Validation of hierarchical IDs / Fixing of hierarchical IDs
** Validation of DocBook against DocBook 5 Schema

* Translation workflow of manuals
** Current idea: Pootle and po4a (http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/)

* Cross-Linking between documents
** Using OLinks?

* User Comments
** these should be bound to a certain XML ID, and appear on section-level
** Should be loaded via AJAX into the page, similar to api.jquery.org -> makes the HTML output by the DocBook stylesheets a lot more simple.

* Integration on typo3.org
** Should all documentation be found on typo3.org, directly in the layout of the page? I guess this is not the optimal layout for viewing documentation, so I am not sure if this makes sense.
** However, if this is wanted, we'd need a separate stylesheet

* in-place editing
** would be only possible in the original language // on the "trunk" documentation, as bugfixes in translations would need to be done in pootle.
** however, would still be cool :-)
** -> should appear as review requests in Gerrit then

* Git Structure of the manuals
** I'd propose that *each manual* has its own Git Repository.
** Furthermore, *all languages* of this manual are also stored in this Git Repository as separate branch or Tags. Not sure yet, if we need branches for older releases; I guess Tags are enough there.
** Example:
*** master_en (English version)
*** master_de (German version)
*** 4.5_en (4.5.X branch, in English)
*** 4.5_de (4.5.X branch, in German)
** People should only be allowed to commit into the _en branches; and all translations need to be updated automatically using Pootle.
